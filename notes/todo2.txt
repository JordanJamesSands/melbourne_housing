changes to pipeline3.R

moved parse_osm_data after splitting_b2
made parse_osm_data.R a fn
very different results:
	-on hand hand, this makes sense, parse_osm_data was permuting property_data, this was before train0 was assigned, so when train0 was assigned some of property data it was a different subset
	-on the other hand, variance in test rmse is really high now!
the changes are saved in pipeline4.R

**consider using ID in folds, not index**
