drop outliers:
	-identify by nbedroom and nbathrooms
	-Try nrooms<=6 and nbathroom<=4
deal with 0 bedrooms and 0 bathrooms
	-leave them in, model them, then act
	
	
make final plot show an estimate of median, use bootstrapping perhaps to get CI for median range, (this is given how many bedrooms etc.)
maybe dont aim to reduce rmse, the error is related to price, (log(price) rmse might be good)
	Yobs = Ytrue*error
	log(Yobs) = log(Ytrue) + log(error)	

	
use log(building_area) and log(land_ara) for lm?

out of the box, the suburb map is super patchy, incorporate this in to the story, (fill in the gaps)

maybe dont drop extreme building area or land_area
	
predict log always, turn back into exp later if you want
	if i dont, the tree with disproportionalety favour expensive properties, (because there is more variance in their price)
make use of nbedroom?
census data
include some aggregate data?
check data with the victorian property sales report from the right time
Reconstruct data, 
	after keeping nbathroom NA
	main NA problem			imputation solution
		year_built 		geographic neighbours
		land_area		?
		building_area	?
		price			do not impute, just drop
		
		nbathroom		?
		ncar			?
		lng				?
		lat				?
		
	after dropping nbathroom NA:
	main NA problem			imputation solution
		price				do not impute
		land_area			? (knn from nrooms?)
		building_area		? (knn from nrooms?)
		year_built			geographic neighbours
